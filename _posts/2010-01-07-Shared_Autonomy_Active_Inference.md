- 1. Shared Reinforcement learning and Free Energy Minimisation in Human-Machine Ensembles 

- 2. Reverse engineering human behavioral priors and preferences with top-down attention during shared control
  - joint control and habitualisation of human and machine behavior
  - reconstructing human priors and preferences (goals) 

- 3. Learning shared preferences and habitualised behavior
  - learning to explore and exploit human behavior
  - learning joint human-machine ensemble preferences
  
- 4. Comparing human-machine and machine-machine performance
