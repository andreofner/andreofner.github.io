*Example for planning and acting in the human-machine agent. 
The model inititally learns to meaningfully switch between human and machine control based on top-down prediction of the behavior resulting from shared control.
In later stages of learning, the model is able to reproduce the observed behavior autonomously and behaves "as if" the human was still part of the control.
